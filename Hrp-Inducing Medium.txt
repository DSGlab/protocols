Hrp-Inducing Medium

Defined mineral salts media is made by adding various carbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids from concentrated, filter-sterilized stocks to M9-salts medium

For P. syringae pv. phaseolicola, the carbon source is sucrose. The final concentrations of the carbon sources or other individual supplements were 5mM and the pH was adjusted to pH 5.5

M9 MINIMAL MEDIUM

Per liter: To 750mL of sterile deionized water (cooled to 50ºC or less), add:

5X M9 salts							200mL
1M MgSO4							2mL
20% carbon source (eg; 20% sucrose)	20mL
1M CaCl2							0.1mL
sterile deionized water				to 1L

If necessary, supplement the M9 medium with stock solutions of the appropriate amino acids

5X M9 salts is made by dissolving the following salts in deionized water to a final volume of 1L:

Na2HPO4 7H2O    64g
KH2PO4          15g
NaCl            2.5g
NH4Cl           5g

The salt solution is divided into 200mL aliquots and sterilized by autoclaving for 15 min at 15 psi on liquid cycle

The MgSO4 and CaCl2 solutions should be prepared separately, sterilized by autoclaving, and added after diluting the 5X M9 salts to 1L with sterile water. Glucose should sterilized by filtration before it is added to the diluted M9 salts.
