Streaking out strains from glycerol

It is very important that the freezer door be open as little as possible to maintain temperature. Glycerol stocks must also be kept as cold as possible: the content of a tube will not survive if they are allowed to thaw completely. Therefore, minimize the amount of time spent in the freezer and work quickly with your stock tube to prevent thaw.

Locate which glycerol stock tube you require in the -80Â°C using the strain list and freezer map. Moving quickly, pull out the box from the rack, and the tube from the box, setting this aside in the freezer. Close the freezer door.

At the flame in the sideroom fume hood, have your plate ready, and a sterilized loop (or sterile pipette tip). Remove the stock tube from the freezer, carefully uncap it, remove a small portion of frozen bacteria with your sterile loop or tip and transfer this to the plate. Quickly return the stock tube to the freezer, then finish streaking out your bacteria. Incubate.
