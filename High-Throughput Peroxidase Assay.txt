Required reagents and equipment
	• Mature but non-bolted (4-5 week old) Arabidopsis plants
	• Cork Borer, #1 disk size (4.8mm diameter)
	• Shaker or rocker
	• Plate reading spectrophotometer
	• 96 well microtitre plates with lids
	• 1.5ml microfuge tubes
	• Forceps
	• Parafilm
	• Sterile 1X MS buffer
	• Sterile ddH20
	• 1M NaOH
	• 1% H2O2
	• 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-AS, Sigma)
 
 
1. Sampling & Pre-Wash
	a. Take one leaf core for each treatment from one Arabidopsis leaf using a #1 or #2 cork borer
	b. Place all the leaf cores for a single treatment into a 1.5 ml microfuge tube containing 1ml of 1X MS
	c. Repeat for a total of 6 replicates per treatment.
	d. Wash disks by gently rotating or rocking for 30 minutes
 
2. Assay Plate Preparation
	a. Use only 10 columns and 6 rows on each microtiter plate. Treatments are arrayed by columns, while replicates are arrayed by rows.
	b. Place 50 μl  of 1X MS containing the treatment peptide in each treatment well
	c. Fill the edge wells completely with sterile ddH2O in order to minimize evaporation and edge effects
 
3. Sample Treatment
	a. Gently place a single leaf disk in the bottom of each well such that a single row of the plate contains disks from a single leaf. This allows a repeated measures analysis to be performed on the results.
	b. Treat each well with the test substance
		• Protein preps – use up to 15 μl
		• Peptides – concentration should be determined empirically, but typically range between 10pM-1uM
	c. Cover the plate and Parafilm the edges
	d. Gentle shake or rock the plate for 16-20 hours in the light at room temperature
 
4. Substrate Preparation
	a. Heat ddH2O to 70oC
	b. Dissolve 10 mg of 5-AS in 10 ml of heated ddH2O
	c. Cool solution to room temperature
	d. pH to ~6 with NaOH
	e. Add 100 μl of 1% H2O2
 
5. Sample Assay
	a. Remove the leaf disks from their microtitre plate wells
	b. Add 50 μlμl of 5-AS solution to each well and mix gently by tapping
	c. Readings
		• The reaction can be stopped via the addition of NaOH at which point final readings are taken at 550 nm
