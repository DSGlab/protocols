Work in the organics fume hood, and dispose of solid and liquid organic waste appropriately.

Mix your sample in a microcentrifuge tube with 0.5 volume TE-saturated phenol, and 0.5 volume chloroform. Centrifuge at 10,000rpm for 5mins at room temp.
Transfer the upper aqueous phase to a fresh tube and add an equal volume of chloroform. Mix, then centrifuge at 10,000rpm for 5mins at room temp.
Transfer the upper phase to a fresh tube. Add 1/10 volume of 3M sodium acetate or 2M sodium chloride and mix, then add an equal volume of cold isopropanol or 2.5 volumes of EtOH to precipitate the DNA.
Incubate for 30-60 mins at -20°C, then centrifuge at 10,000rpm for 10mins.
Discard the supernatant, and rinse the pellet by adding 1mL 70% cold EtOH, and spin at 10,000 for 5mins. Rinse again, then air-dry the pellet.
Dissolve the pellet in sterile dH2O or TE buffer for further use. Store at -20°.
