Setting up a sequencing reaction

For plasmid templates:
Place at 86º for 5 minutes, then cool to room temp before adding to the sequencing reaction. For plasmids <5 kb, use 100ng/kb. For larger plasmids, consult CAGEF to determine appropriate reaction conditions.

For PCR product templates:
If nice, strong PCR product bands are seen upon running 1/10th of the sample on an agarose gel (ie. 2ul run out of 20ul), perform enzymatic cleanup protocol first:

For a 20uL PCR reaction volume, add 0.2uL ExoI (1/100th vol) and 0.2uL CIP (1/100th vol)
Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
Inactivate at 85°C for 15 minutes.
Proceed to sequencing reaction below.

Add up to 5ul of template, whether enzymatically cleaned PCR product or purified plasmid.

Cycle sequencing reaction:

Reagent (1X)
template PCR: ~50ng, plasmid: 250-500 ng (see above).
BigDye mix: 0.5µl
10uM primer: 0.5µl (0.5µM)
5X seq buffer: 1.75µl
ddH2O: up to 10µl 

The example above used 3ul of template, but you can use more or less and adjust the water. If you need Betaine, add 2ul to a 10ul reaction (1M final conc.), and adjust the water.

Sequencing cycle program: 
1. 96°C, 1 minute 1 X
2. 96°C, 10 seconds 
3. 50°C, 5 seconds 
4. 60°C, 4minutes 
5. Repeat steps 2-4 45X*
6. 60°C, 4 minutes 1X
4°C for ever
