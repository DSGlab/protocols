Performing an HR assay   

Arabidopsis:

One day prior to inoculation of the plants, set up an overnight culture on solid media, and label the plants with their intended treatment.

On day of inoculation, dome plants for at least 15 min to open stomata. Resuspend a loopful of bacteria in 1 mL of 10mM MgSO4 and determine the OD600 of this suspension.

For standard HR assays, the final OD600 will be 0.3, 0.1 and 0.03 (1.5 x 108, 5 x 107 and 1.5 x 107). Each Arabidopsis leaf requires approximately 200uL, and you will be infiltrating 1 leaf per plant * 6 plants. You will thus need 2mL of inoculum for each concentration:

Required vol. of bacterial suspension = [(final OD600)(final volume)]/[(OD600)(dilution factor)] 

Draw up the final suspension with a 1mL blunt end syringe, then gently infiltrate the undersides of the left side of each leaf. Infiltrate a different leaf on each plant with each strain of bacteria being tested.

Leave plants in lab overnight. Score HR symptoms 16+ hrs after innoculation. Weak HRs will require up to 24 hrs to score. Photograph leaves against matte black background with sides blocked using flash.

  Bean Pods:

Materials:
   96 well plate
   50 mL conical full of 70% ethanol
   sterile toothpicks

Protocol:
1. Use pods attached to plants, 1 pod/strain being tested.
2. Prepare strains by resuspending fresh overnights in 500 mL 10 mM MgSO4 in microfuge tubes; spec to get concentration.
3. Prepare inocula:
   -in 96 well plate
   -100 µL 10 mM MgSO4
   -add resuspended cultures to needed concentration (5x108 = OD 1.0)
4. Surface sterilize each pod by immersing in 50 mL conical of 70% ethanol for 20 sec.
5. Allow pod to dry.
6. Deposit 2 µL drop of inoculum onto pod along horizontal middle.
7. Jab toothpick into middle of inoculum drop, through tissue.
8. Keep inoculations at least 0.5 cm apart (6 inoculations / pod)
9. Allow to air dry (do not let run!)
10. Score after two days (water soaking = virulence; sunken red = HR)
