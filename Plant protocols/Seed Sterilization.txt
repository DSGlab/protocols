Seed Sterilization

In a 1.5 mL tube, measure out 10-15 mg of seed per plate
Add 1 mL of sterilizing solution (10% bleach, 0.01% Triton X-100), agitate gently for 15 min.
Briefly spin the tube to collect the seeds at the bottom of the tube
Pour off the solution, add 1 mL of sterile water
Shake the tube gently, spin again, pour off the water, and repeat for a total of at least six washes or until no residual bleach/ detergent is detected.


To sterilize larger volumes of seeds, scale up and sterilize in either 15ml or 50ml falcon tubes with appropriate amount of sterilizing solution.
Sterilizing solution must be made fresh each time 
Do not leave seeds in the sterilizing solution longer than 20 minutes as the seed coat will be destroyed
