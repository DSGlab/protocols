Setting up a PCR

Obtain a styrofoam box full of ice. After reagents have thawed, tap all tubes to mix, then spin down the contents very briefly. Place all reagents (DMSO and enzyme excepted) on ice. Label your PCR strip tubes and prepare the reaction in a microcentrifuge tube. Start by adding the dH2O, then add reagents in the order listed. Enzyme is added last. Mix the tube gently, then aliquot into the PCR strip tubes.

Always prepare a negative control (omit template) to verify the absence of contamination.

A common PCR reaction is as follows:
Reagents: 1X (uL)
Genomic DNA (dilution): 1
10X Taq buffer w/ KCl: 2.5
25mM MgCl2: 1.5
2mM dNTPs: 2.5
DMSO: 1.25
10mM primer+: 0.25
10mM primer-: 0.25
Ferm. Taq: 0.25
dH2O: 15.5
Total: 25

Cap strip tubes tightly, then place in the PCR machine. Find the appropriate ‘3-step’ program, altering the primer annealing step accordingly.

A common PCR cycle program is as follows:

1. 94°C for 2mins (initial denaturation)
2. 94°C for 30secs (denaturation)
3. XX°C for 30secs (primer annealing) XX = primer Tm - 5°C
4. 72°C for 1min (extension)
5. Repeat steps 2-4 35X
6. 72°C for 5min (final extension)
10°C soak
