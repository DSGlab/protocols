Performing a growth assay

One day prior to inoculation of the plants, set up an overnight culture on solid media, and label the plants with their intended treatment.

On day of inoculation, dome plants for at least 15 min to open stomata. Resuspend a loopful of bacteria in 1 mL of 10mM MgSO4 and determine the OD600 of this suspension.

For standard growth assays, the final OD600 will be 0.0002-0.0005 (1-2.5 x 105 cells/mL). Each Arabidopsis leaf requires approximately 200uL, and you will be infiltrating 4 leaves per plant * 6 plants / treatment / day. For a growth assay including 4 days, you will thus need 20mL of inoculum:

Required vol. of bacterial suspension = [(final OD600)(final volume)]/[(OD600)(dilution factor)] 

Draw up the final suspension with a 10mL blunt end syringe, then gently infiltrate the undersides of the leaves. When complete, proceed to assaying the growth of the bacteria in the plant at day 0. 

Set out: scissors, tweezers, leaf punch, 70% EtOH (sterilization of leaf punch surfaces), 90% EtOH (tool sterilization), labeled microcentrifuge tubes (6 per treatment) each with 200μl 10mM MgSO4 and a single sterile bead, a dilution plate, multichannel and plates with the appropriate antibiotics. 

1. Harvest 4 leaf punches/plant (1 punch/leaf, 4 leaves/plant, 6 plants/treatment/day) and sterilize 10s in 70% EtOH. 

2. Dry lightly on kimwipe, and place in microcentrifuge tube. Sterilize punch, tweezers and scissors between each use. Repeat for all plants/treatments. 

3. Label plates and place in the hood to dry.

4. Grind leaf discs. Add 90μl of 10mM MgSO4 to 2nd, 3rd (etc) rows of the dilution plate.

5. Add 100μl of homogenate to first row and serially dilute by transferring 10uL into the next row, mixing at each step.

6. Plate 10-20uL of each dilution and incubate overnight. 

7. The next day (some strains may require 2 days for colonies to be visible), record the number of colonies at each dilution.
