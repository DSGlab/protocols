Growing overnight cultures of bacteria

For liquid cultures, add 5mL 1X KB (for P. syringae) or 1X LB (for P. aeruginosa or E. coli) to a sterile green top test tube with a sterile glass pipette. Add the appropriate antibiotic, swirl gently.

When inoculating off a plate, flame a loop, allow to cool momentarily, then draw the loop across the bacterial lawn until a small amount is visibly clinging to the loop. Insert the loop into the liquid media, and swirl gently.
Place the test tube into a rack in the shaker on a slant, and shake overnight at 30째C (for P. syringae) or 37째 (for P. aeruginosa or E. coli). 

Plates are placed lid-side down in the 30째C or 37째C incubators.
