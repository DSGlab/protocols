Pouring plates

For 20 plates, use 200mL each 2X media and 2X agar. For 40, use 400mL each.
Light your flame and ensure you have ready the antibiotics to be added, 1M MgSO4 (if using KB), the stack of plates to be filled (in groups of 5) and the 2X media.
Loosen the cap slightly on the 2X agar, and microwave in short bursts of 30-60s, pulling the bottle out regularly to swirl.

When the bottle of agar is completely melted, transfer the contents to the bottle of 2X media, after sterilizing the lip of each bottle in the flame. Swirl gently.
When you can comfortably hold the bottle of 1X media, add antibiotics and MgSO4 (if necessary) and swirl to mix. Begin pouring plates, starting from the lowest plate in the stack.
