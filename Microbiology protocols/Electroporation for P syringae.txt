Electroporation for P. syringae

Materials Needed:
KB broth.
0.5 M sucrose (171.15 g/L), filter sterilized, store at 4oC.
Pre-chilled 0.2 mm cuvettes (on ice).

General Notes:
Keep cells as cold as possible throughout protocol.
Perform washes as fast as possible. Do not let cells sit for any period of time.
Pre-cool cuvettes and centrifuge. Pre-warm plates.

Protocol:
1. Grow bacteria overnight in 5 mL aliquots of KB broth at 30oC. Best results are obtained when the cells inoculated to broth are very "fresh."

2. Cool culture on ice and pellet 1 mL of cells for 10 min at 1500 xg (4000 RPM for Beckman Coulter tabletop). 

3. Decant off medium and resuspend cells by pipetting up and down in 1 mL of ice-cold 0.5 M sucrose. Pellet cells again (10 min 1500 xg).

4. Repeat step 3 twice more.

5. Resuspend final pellet in 0.2 to 0.5 mL of 0.5 M sucrose (OD600 approx 3). Cells can be kept on ice for several hours if necessary.

6. Add 0.1 - 1 ug of plasmid DNA to 200 uL of washed cells in pre-chilled cuvette (amount of DNA should be varied, but volume should not exceed 5 uL). Mix gently and electroporate within 30 min.

7. Electroporate at settings of 2.5 kV, 400 ohms and 25 uf. (if using 0.1 mm cuvettes, reduce resistance to 200 ohms).

8. Immediately after pulse add 1 mL of KB broth to cuvette, gently mix cells, and transfer to test tube.

9. Incubate 1.5 - 2 hr at 30oC in shaker to recover cells, then plate onto the appropriate pre-warmed plates (Efficiency is often very high, so plate outÂ  10-20 uL on one plate to avoid getting a lawn).
